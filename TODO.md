- [ ] Use a top-layer root window instead of 'dragging container'
- [ ] Change API to use UTIs and promises
- [ ] Have client app ask server app for modelObject on demand instead of up front
- [ ] Establish a TCP connection to do the transfer of the modelObject (so that it can be big)
- [ ] If drop target doesn't accept drop, don't send the drop to it when dragging ends!
